**FOR MEMBERS OR ENTITIES WANTING TO BE MEMBERS:**

What benefits does the Exousia System provide you?
* Less work load for your technical teams - you can count on us to meet some of your services (remember the Partnership is still developing)
* Technical work and services from other members are open source to other members - most of the time - meaning you can use there services and modify them as well - you don't need to start from scratch making a new service
* Work with other, probably more experienced, members - hire personnel from other companies to help you with technical projects and develop greater relations between other members and within the Partnership
* Justice Affairs protected - anyone breaking the rules can easily be punished for technical violations within the Exousia Systems GitHub organisation and other communications methods
* And more to come! - The partnership is still developing

**Proposed features (may change, be added, or removed any time or in the future):**
* Technical support through AI (ChatGPT) and tutorials/guides
* Documentation in the future for all services
